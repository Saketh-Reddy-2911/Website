# About Me

**Hi myself SAKETH REDDY PUCHAKAYALA mechanical engineer from India currently pursuing Master's of science in Data Analytics Engineering at George Mason University, fairfax VA. I am from mechanical background but i am so much fascinated towards data related things and i believe that any stream we may consider involves data related aspects in it. That interest made me take this course at graduation level and came all the way leaving my family and friends. Now my ultimate goal is to interlink my mechanical knowledge with the data analytics ideas and come up with my own firm.**
